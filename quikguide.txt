Quick breakdown on how FakerMiP works:
Broadcast: One MiP shouts to the entire "room" (your network, port 2014 UDP).

Identity: Every MiP knows who is talking, so they don't respond to their own voice.

Empathy: They react to friends leaving with a sad sound.

Rhythm: They wait a moment after hearing a dance to make the movement look natural and unsynchronized.
